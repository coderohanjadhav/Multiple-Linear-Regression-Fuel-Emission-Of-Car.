# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Fuel-Emission-Of-Car.
Multiple Linear Regression In this lab, we learn how to use scikit-learn library to implement Multiple linear regression. We again use the Carbon dioxide emission dataset to build a model, Evaluate the model, and finally use model to predict unknown value. Lets get started.
